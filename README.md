# General Tree Folder Structure

## Overview
This Java project implements a general tree data structure to represent and manipulate a folder structure. It includes functionalities such as displaying the tree, searching for nodes, and performing various tree traversals.

## Features
- **Tree Display**: Visual representation of the folder structure in a tree format.
- **Node Search**: Ability to search for a specific node within the tree.
- **Tree Traversals**: Supports different tree traversal methods including BFS, PreOrder, and PostOrder.
- **Node Operations**: Functionalities to insert and delete nodes in the tree.
- **Folder Statistics**: Provides the count of files and folders within a given directory.

## How to Run
To run the application:
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Navigate to the `src` directory.
4. Compile and run `GeneralTreeDriver.java` (Make sure you modify the **path** variable in this class to the directory you want to display as a tree structure).

## Key Components
- **GeneralTree**: The main class that implements the general tree structure. ([GeneralTree.java](https://github.com/AbdullahAlzeid/General-Tree-folder-structure/blob/main/src/GeneralTree.java))
- **GeneralTreeNode**: Represents a node in the general tree. ([GeneralTreeNode.java](https://github.com/AbdullahAlzeid/General-Tree-folder-structure/blob/main/src/GeneralTreeNode.java))
- **GeneralTreeDriver**: The driver class with a main method to run the application. ([GeneralTreeDriver.java](https://github.com/AbdullahAlzeid/General-Tree-folder-structure/blob/main/src/GeneralTreeDriver.java))
- **Queue**: A utility class used for tree traversal. ([Queue.java](https://github.com/AbdullahAlzeid/General-Tree-folder-structure/blob/main/src/Queue.java))

## Usage
- Run the `GeneralTreeDriver` class.
- Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the tree.
- Choose different options to display the tree, search for nodes, perform traversals, and more.
